## Reporting Security Issues

At UC Main CSPS, we take security issues and vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any potential security concerns you may encounter.

To report a security issue, please send an email to [ucmaincsps@gmail.com](mailto:ucmaincsps@gmail.com) with the following details:

- Description of the vulnerability/exploit
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any potential impact of the vulnerability

We will review and respond to your report in a timely manner. We kindly request that you allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it to the public or third parties.

## Security Vulnerability Response

Once a security issue is reported, our team will:

- Acknowledge the receipt of the report within 24 hours
- Evaluate the reported issue and assess its impact
- Take necessary steps to reproduce and validate the vulnerability
- Develop and implement a fix or mitigation strategy

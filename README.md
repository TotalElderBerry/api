This v2 branch repository is part of the UC Main CSP-S organization's website, which provides information about our events, activities, and services to the UC Main CCS (College of Computer Studies) students.

## What's new?

This `v2` branch repository is a complete rewrite of the UC Main CSP-S backend API server. It is now built with [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) which is an ultra-fast javascript backend framework and is now using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its javascript/typescript runtime environment. Which is a lot faster than Node.js and its speed is on par with compiled languages like C and Go.

## Why do we rewrite the backend API server?

The old backend API server was built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) which is a javascript backend framework. It was built with it because it was the only frameowork that we knew at the time. But as we learned more about backend development, we discovered and and realized that Bun.js is a lot faster than Node.js for backend development. 

We, as a computer science students, we want to use the most efficient and fastest frameworks for our projects, not just "If it works, don't touch it" kind of thing. In this way, we can deliver the best experience to our users without sacrificing the performance of our backend API server.
